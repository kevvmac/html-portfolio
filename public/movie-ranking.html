 <h2>Few picks off the top of my head</h2>

 <h3>The Boy and the Heron</h3>

<p>Slow burn, studio ghibli animation. Cathartic ending of a boy's journey through loss and grief.</p>

<h3>Dune 2</h3>

<p>Epic cinema. Paul and Chani's chemistry is great. Scene of Mua'dib rise to power is chilling. </p>

<h3>The Secret Life of Walter Mitty</h3>

<p>So artistic. The shots of Iceland with the skateboarding scene are breathtaking.</p>
<p>"Beautiful things don't ask for attention." -Sean Penn's character</p>
